## Implementation 001
This first iteration has the intension to create the simplest possible implementation, probably a Junior approach to the problem.

As described in the [issue #2](https://github.com/users/danielyoshizawa/projects/2?pane=issue&itemId=43213369), the idea is to have a better undestanding of the problem, not focusing in anything else.

This implementation took around 10 minutes if so, I simple read the Requirements
and followed through in a non brainer matter. Extreme Go Horse ftw!
